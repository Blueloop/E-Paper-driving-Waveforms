**Material for the Talk:** Energy-Aware E-Paper Driving: Open Waveforms for Sustainable, Low-Power Displays

E-Paper technology is often highlighted for its reflective readability and near-zero static power consumption, making it an attractive choice in a world where digital displays are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. From public transport signage to smart meters and IoT devices, the number of deployed displays continues to grow—and with it, the cumulative energy they consume. A sustainable future does not require removing or avoiding displays, but rather designing and driving them intelligently.

This talk explores how E-Paper systems can significantly reduce active energy usage through optimized waveform design, voltage-generation strategies, and open-source development practices. We uncover the electrical and algorithmic principles behind E-Paper driving and illustrate how waveform look-up tables (LUTs) determine update speed, ghosting behavior, image quality, and—critically—energy consumption.

Attendees will gain a practical understanding of how to tune E-Paper systems for sustainable low-power infrastructure, and battery-driven IoT devices—demonstrating that digital innovation and energy efficiency can go hand in hand.
